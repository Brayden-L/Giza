P1 starts with a tough move into the crack proper, using the leaning right crack for locks and feet. Easy until the finish where you have to burl through some steep wide.
P2 crux is also off the deck. An easy foot ramp takes you to a tips crack where a good nut and a high 0.2 can be placed. Crank off some good locks, place a good piece high and be ready to fire. Don’t bother with the arete on the left, focus on cranking slightly off fingers and driving hard with that right foot. Getting your LHTU in the slot finishes the crux.

2022-07-23,"Positive Vibrations",5.11a,"With Ross. Led evens. Fell twice at the crux. Everything else went in good style.

P1: A nice warmup, best linked into pitch 2.
P2: A short tips crux, be sure to use a foot out right. Then a more powerful fingers crux. Both short and connected with easy ground.
P3: Easy ground to the crux traverse. You can go low across to the steep handcrack, or go straight up to a downward facing flake to pull right directly across to the jugs. We went low.
P4: Sustained pitch. Lots of stemming in the chimney corner thing into some steep pulls. Finished with parallel cracks where I stayed left which felt more like .10+, beta says to move into the right crack halfway or so. This one will make you breath hard.
P5: Relaxed .10a pitch, mostly hands. Cruiser.
P6: The money pitch. Starts with tricky stemming, goes easier than it looks. Use those gashes in the left wall! Roof pull has good gear and is actually pretty low key. The following section is steep and pumpy. The finger crack that follows is also steep and pumpy. This is a hard pitch even before the crux.
P6: Crux. I split this pitch. Be tough and carry it through next time. 2 black totems and a 0.5 are all you need to protect it. Pull on good locks. I would stay in the cracks until you can get the your right hand nicely into the top right pod. Then you can cleanly  get a hand on each crimp and reach far left around the arete for a good hold, lower is juicier and pull around.
P7: Steep but not too bad section to start. Tough part is the step across, just make sure you traverse midway where there are nice fins to grab and not high up at the roof where it is extra tough.
P8: Long pitch of steep glory hands. Enjoy it, you earned it.

2022-05-14,Astroman,5.11c,"With Eric Newcomb. Astroboys. Retreated after Harding slot. Recommend to pitch out the wandering start and the .10a section, rope drag was gnarly. Boulder problem is tough but good gear. Piker’s variation is stiff stemming but not crazy hard. Would recommend 2x 0.1’s if you want to do that. Enduro corner is crazy long and steep. Thin hands on the steep part, milk the hand jams and looks for stems. Hard line finger jamming up high. Easy 5.9 pitch is nice and chill. The next pitch is .10c and relatively relaxed, lots of good hand jams. Remember the small nuts for a key placement near the layback up high. The Harding slot pretty crazy. Steep layback is punchy but doable if you power it up. Entry moves are cryptic but requires creative use of heel + knee/hip. Gear is good and there is a nice rest before you dive in. It is a pretty relaxed squeeze until a body length from when it widens. It really squeezes there. I couldn’t get myself to get forward progress. Eric recommended “pencilling” where your legs are straight up and down instead of typical splayed froggy legs. Cam your feet HEEL UP bringing the top knuckles of your toe in contact instead of typical heel down and extend your legs using double arm bars at chest-ish height. This method gets you a half inch at a time so it’ll take something like 100+ reps of this movement. Breathe out as you extend up. Don’t get suckered into the outside once you’re in, it’s too tight. It wasn’t as scary as I thought because you can always just slide back down, I don’t think you can get “stuck”. Maybe with the pencil method I can make it through next time.

Led the hollow flake, panted like a dog after topping it, no pro makes for an epic pitch. Also led the ear, invert Bombay chimney is fucked up. Had to remove my glasses to turn my head. Partner bonked on the ear follow, had to pick up all the rest of the leads to the spire. Spanning the spire gap in the dark was epic. Third day to long ledge. Led all the wide pitches and C2 crux pitches. Sous le toit, enduro corner and roof pitch all super cool. Made it to headwall, position is insane. Partner took three whips off of C2 crux of headwall. I had to step up for it. I blew a fluke placement leaving the belay in the C1, factor 2’d, flipped upside down, rope wrapped around Ross’s neck, instantly knocked him out, I realized from his limp body and gurgling what was going on. I managed to grab onto the portaledge hanging below the haul bag and unweighted the rope, Ross immediately regained consciousness and removed rope from neck, was in confused panic. I was still hanging in free space, unsure if Ross could hold me in a factor 2 position in his state. I frantically managed to grab a ladder and attach it the bottom of the bag, ascended through Ross’s ladders back to belay. Ross super shaken understandably, said he felt like he was dreaming for hours, neck bruised and burnt but no serious damage somehow. I managed to calm him down and lead the C2 crux fine. Got to long ledge, thin sleeping. Ross actually in good spirits despite his strangulation. Chose to lead 5.10 C1 off long ledge, crazy exposed and interesting climbing.
